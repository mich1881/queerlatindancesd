      <h1>Michelle's Dance Journey</h1>
      <h2>& HER LIFELONG LOVE OF MOVEMENT</h2>
      <div class="journey-layout">
        <div class="journey-left">
          <p>Michelle's passion for physical training and dance started in her hometown, El Centro, California. Growing up in a border town gave her the opportunity to take karate in Mexicali with dedicated instructors, to whom she is forever grateful, alongside her mother, who played a huge role in her early success. Her music background consists of classical choir and playing violin which fuels her interest in the instruments and rhythms that bring Latin music to life. Her training also included dance and competitive gymnastics, where she developed discipline and body awareness, building the foundation for her lifelong love of movement.</p>
          
          <p>Michelle's Latin dance journey began at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) while pursuing her engineering studies. She enrolled in classes with Tony Caligagan, which expanded her knowledge of both salsa and bachata. Through these classes, she learned the importance of structured lessons in teaching the fundamentals of Latin dance, a principle she is working to apply in her own teaching to ensure her students' success.</p>
          
          <p>In Mexicali, Michelle noticed a strong emphasis on discipline in gymnastics, karate, and dance, with teacher-student relationships built on respect and trust. This structure gave instructors the space to push and challenge her. She recalls days she did not want to go to karate classes, but showing up consistently was expected and it made all the difference. "I may not have appreciated it when I was 6 to 12 years old, but looking back, I am so grateful. It taught me how to be consistent, how to put in the work, and that is something I carry with me in dance to this day." - Michelle Fernandez</p>
          
          <p>Her karate training consisted of full splits and stretching, then moving into strength and conditioning exercises. "They made us do push-ups, ab workouts, and drills. Like training for the Marines (haha), by the time I was six, I had a six-pack".- Michelle F. This foundation of strength and flexibility made learning gymnastics, dance, and pole much easier. Paired with her experience in choir, it also helped her develop rhythm, musicality, and a strong connection to music, skills that continue to inform everything she does in dance.</p>
          
          <p>After graduating, Michelle continued her dance journey while pursuing a career in structural engineering. She joined Sokaliente, a salsa and bachata group led by Tien Le, performing at festivals, learning from dance professionals, and immersing herself in the rhythms of Latin dance. During this time, she refined her footwork, learned to dance salsa On2, and incorporated the importance of warm-ups and technique into her lessons.</p>
          
          <p>After taking a break from dance during the COVID-19 pandemic, Michelle pursued her Master's in Structural Engineering, around the same time she met her partner, Pat. Coming out and meeting Pat marked a pivotal moment in her life. Once she completed her Master's, Michelle returned to dancing, introducing Pat to Latin dance. They experienced pushback and hostility in some dance spaces, highlighting the lack of queer representation and inclusivity. When Michelle began learning how to lead, she encountered barriers that underscored the need for more welcoming spaces.</p>
          
          <p>These experiences inspired her to create Queer Latin Dance SD, a community where everyone can dance freely, regardless of gender identity or expression. Her goal is to build a thriving, inclusive queer Latin dance community in San Diego and share her knowledge to help the community grow, thrive, and succeed in dance together.</p>

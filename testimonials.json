    "text": "I've been taking bachata series with @queerlatindancesd and I highly recommend. In the Latin dance community the gender roles are so strict and if you don't fit within that role it can be highly discouraging. Not to mention there is not a lot of room for self expression. These classes are breaking that mold and making such a warm and welcoming space for all individuals. Cannot say enough good things about the series.",

    "text": "I used to forget little things constantly ever since I was young. I didn’t engage in a lot of mentally stimulating activities or physical exercise, especially when I reached high school. Then I met Michelle, who is a dancer and the founder of QLDSD, and naturally she convinced me to learn. Michelle started teaching me to dance, and I was resistant for years. Anytime I tried to dance, it was difficult to recall the patterns, and I couldn’t quite make my limbs move how I wanted. So it took a lot of convincing to be more consistent. Being more consistent with learning how to dance I realize that it improved my memory! My body feels healthier and I'm not tired all the time. Before, I didn’t care much about dance, but now I recommend dance to everyone, more importantly to those who say they can’t dance or have never danced before. Whatever excuse you tell others or yourself, it’s always a great decision to learn to dance in a safe space. I’m more excited than ever to be around queer folks and learn more from my partner and other instructors out there. Michelle is a patient teacher and a passionate dancer. Learning dance from her has improved a lot of areas in my life!",
